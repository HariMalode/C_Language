###  Ellaborate about the C language
###  Uses of C?


1. **What is Programming?**
   Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to execute, using a specific language like Python, Java, or C++.

2. **Elaborate about the C language**
   C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. It is known for its efficiency, portability, and low-level access to memory, making it widely used for system software, operating systems, and embedded systems.

3. **Uses of C?**
   - Developing operating systems (e.g., Unix, Linux)
   - Creating embedded systems
   - Building compilers and interpreters
   - Developing game engines
   - Network programming
   - Database systems development

### Q2. Tell us about 
1. Variables
2. Constants
3. Keywords
4. Compiler
5. A program include all input types 

Sure, here are the short explanations:

1. **Variables**:
   - Variables are used to store data that can be changed during program execution.
   - Declared with a type (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`).
   - Example: `int age = 25;`

2. **Constants**:
   - Constants are used to store data that cannot be changed once assigned.
   - Declared using the `const` keyword or `#define` preprocessor directive.
   - Example: `const int MAX_SIZE = 100;` or `#define PI 3.14`

3. **Keywords**:
   - Keywords are reserved words with special meaning in C.
   - Cannot be used as identifiers (variable names).
   - Examples: `int`, `return`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`.

4. **Compiler**:
   - A compiler translates the C code into machine code that the computer can execute.
   - Checks for syntax errors and optimizes the code.
   - Examples of C compilers: GCC, Clang, Microsoft Visual C++.

5. **A Program Including All Input Types**:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>

   int main() {
       int intVar;
       float floatVar;
       char charVar;
       double doubleVar;

       printf("Enter an integer: ");
       scanf("%d", &intVar);

       printf("Enter a float: ");
       scanf("%f", &floatVar);

       printf("Enter a character: ");
       scanf(" %c", &charVar);

       printf("Enter a double: ");
       scanf("%lf", &doubleVar);

       printf("You entered: %d, %f, %c, %lf\n", intVar, floatVar, charVar, doubleVar);

       return 0;
   }
   ```

  float result = a + b; // 'a' is automatically converted to float
  ```

#### Explicit Type Conversion (Casting)
- **Manual conversion**: The programmer explicitly converts one data type to another using cast operators.
- **Syntax**: `(type) value`
- **Example**:
  ```c
  float a = 5.5;
  int b = (int) a; // 'a' is explicitly converted to int
  ```

### Q4. Tell us about all Conditional Expression
1. if else
2. switch
3. One liner(ternary)



### 1. `if` and `else` Statements

#### `if` Statement
- Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  if (condition) {
      // code to be executed if condition is true
  }
  ```

#### `if...else` Statement
- Executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block if it is false.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  if (condition) {
      // code to be executed if condition is true
  } else {
      // code to be executed if condition is false
  }
  ```

#### `if...else if...else` Statement
- Tests multiple conditions and executes corresponding blocks of code.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  if (condition1) {
      // code to be executed if condition1 is true
  } else if (condition2) {
      // code to be executed if condition2 is true
  } else {
      // code to be executed if both conditions are false
  }
  ```

### 2. `switch` Statement

- Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  switch (expression) {
      case value1:
          // code to be executed if expression == value1
          break;
      case value2:
          // code to be executed if expression == value2
          break;
      // you can have any number of case statements
      default:
          // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
  }
  ```

### 3. One-liner (Ternary) Operator

- A shorthand for `if...else` that assigns a value based on a condition.
- **Syntax**:
  ```c
  variable = (condition) ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```c
  int a = 10, b = 20;

### Q5. Tell us about
1. ASCII Values and its application
2. While Loop
3. Do while Loop
4. For loop
( write small theory too and  loop feature)
5. Increment and decrement operator ( i++, ++i)
6. use of  continue  keyword
7. use of  break  keyword

Certainly! Let's delve into each topic one by one.

### 1. ASCII Values and Its Application
**ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** is a character encoding standard that uses numeric values to represent characters. Each character (letters, digits, punctuation marks, etc.) is assigned a unique numeric code between 0 and 127.

**Applications:**
- **Text Processing:** ASCII codes are used to encode characters in text files.
- **Communication Protocols:** ASCII is used in communication protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and email.
- **Keyboard Input:** Keyboards send ASCII codes to the computer to represent key presses.
- **Programming:** ASCII values are used in C and other programming languages for character manipulation.

Example: 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char ch = 'A';
    printf("The ASCII value of %c is %d\n", ch, ch); // Output: The ASCII value of A is 65
    return 0;
}
```

### 2. While Loop
The `while` loop in C is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition. The condition is evaluated before executing the loop's body.

**Syntax:**
```c
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

**Features:**
- The condition is checked before entering the loop.
- If the condition is false initially, the loop body is not executed at all.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Do While Loop
The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but the condition is evaluated after the loop's body has been executed. This guarantees that the loop's body is executed at least once.

**Syntax:**
```c
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

**Features:**
- The loop body is executed at least once.
- The condition is checked after the loop body is executed.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    do {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    } while (i < 5);
    return 0;
}
```

### 4. For Loop
The `for` loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly with a specific syntax that includes initialization, condition, and iteration expression.

**Syntax:**
```c
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

**Features:**
- Initialization is executed once at the beginning.
- The condition is checked before each iteration.
- The iteration expression is executed after each iteration of the loop body.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. Increment and Decrement Operators (i++, ++i)
These operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1.

- **i++ (Post-increment):** The value of `i` is used in the expression first, and then `i` is incremented.
- **++i (Pre-increment):** The value of `i` is incremented first, and then the new value is used in the expression.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 5;
    printf("%d\n", i++); // Output: 5 (i is incremented to 6 after this line)
    printf("%d\n", i);   // Output: 6

    i = 5;
    printf("%d\n", ++i); // Output: 6 (i is incremented to 6 before this line)
    return 0;
}
```

### 6. Use of `continue` Keyword
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (i == 2) {
            continue; // Skip the rest of the loop when i is 2
        }
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### 7. Use of `break` Keyword
The `break` statement terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement in which it appears.

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (i == 2) {
            break; // Exit the loop when i is 2
        }
        printf("%d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

These basic constructs and operators are fundamental in C programming and are widely used in various applications, from simple scripts to complex systems.

### Q6. Number Guessing Game

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<time.h>
int main(){
    int num,guess,nguess=1;
    srand(time(0));
    num=rand()%100+1;
   //printf("\n The Number is:%d",num);
    do{ printf("\n Guess The Number Between[1-100]:");
     scanf("%d",&guess);
     if(guess>num){
        printf("\n Your Number is Greater,Put Lower Number:");
     }
     else if(guess<num){
        printf("\n Your Number is Smaller,Put Greater Number:");
     }
     else{
        printf("\n Congrats!!!, You Guess it in %d Guesses",nguess);
       }
        nguess++;
    }while(guess!=num);
    return 0;
}
```

Here is a simple example of inputs and outputs for the given code:

### Example 1:
1. **Random number generated by the program**: 57 (This is not visible to the user)

#### User Inputs and Corresponding Outputs:
- **User input**: 50
  - **Output**: "\n Your Number is Smaller, Put Greater Number:"
- **User input**: 75
  - **Output**: "\n Your Number is Greater, Put Lower Number:"
- **User input**: 60
  - **Output**: "\n Your Number is Greater, Put Lower Number:"
- **User input**: 55
  - **Output**: "\n Your Number is Smaller, Put Greater Number:"
- **User input**: 57
  - **Output**: "\n Congrats!!!, You Guess it in 5 Guesses"

### Q7. Tell us about 
1. Functions and its use ( function prototype, function defination, function calling)
2. Recursions
3. Passing values to functions as argument

Certainly! Let's discuss each topic in detail:

### 1. Functions and Their Use
**Functions** are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They help in modularizing the code, making it more readable, reusable, and easier to maintain. Functions in C can be divided into three parts: function prototype, function definition, and function calling.

#### Function Prototype
A function prototype declares the function to the compiler. It specifies the function's name, return type, and parameters (if any) without providing the function body. It is usually placed at the beginning of the program or in a header file.

**Syntax:**
```c
return_type function_name(parameter_list);
```

Example:
```c
int add(int, int); // Function prototype
```

#### Function Definition
The function definition provides the actual body of the function. It includes the code that specifies what the function does.

**Syntax:**
```c
return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

Example:
```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // Function definition
}
```

#### Function Calling
A function call invokes the function to execute its code. This can be done by using the function name followed by parentheses containing any required arguments.

**Syntax:**
```c
function_name(argument_list);
```

Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
int add(int, int);

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3); // Function call
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### 2. Recursion
**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. It allows problems to be solved in a natural, self-referential manner. Recursive functions typically have a base case (the condition under which the function stops calling itself) and a recursive case (the part where the function calls itself).

**Example of a Recursive Function:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
int factorial(int n);

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", num, factorial(num));
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1; // Base case
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
    }
}
```

### 3. Passing Values to Functions as Arguments
Functions can accept values (arguments) from the calling code. These arguments are specified in the function's parameter list. There are two primary ways to pass arguments to functions in C:

#### Pass by Value
When arguments are passed by value, a copy of the actual value is passed to the function. Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument.

**Example:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void increment(int a);

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    increment(x);
    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x); // x remains 5
    return 0;
}

void increment(int a) {
    a = a + 1; // This change will not affect x in main
}
```

#### Pass by Reference (using pointers)
When arguments are passed by reference, the function receives the address of the argument. Changes made to the parameter inside the function affect the original argument.

**Example:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void increment(int *a);

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    increment(&x);
    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x); // x is now 6
    return 0;
}

void increment(int *a) {
    *a = *a + 1; // This change will affect x in main
}
```

By using functions, recursion, and passing arguments effectively, you can write modular, maintainable, and efficient code in C.
